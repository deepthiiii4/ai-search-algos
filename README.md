# AI Search Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms used for traversing graphs. The project covers both uninformed and informed search strategies, making it a comprehensive tool for pathfinding and search-based problems.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **A* Search Algorithm**
- **Hill Climbing**
- **British Museum Search**
- **Beam Search**
- **Branch and Bound** (with variations such as Dead Horse and Heuristics)
- **Oracle Search**
- **Alpha beta pruning**

## Features
- Support for graph-based problem-solving.
- Utilizes both heuristic and edge cost calculations where necessary.
- Comprehensive handling of common search challenges such as dead-ends, optimal pathfinding, and hill climbing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 8 or later**



```bash
javac algorithms/SearchAlgorithms.java
java algorithms.SearchAlgorithms
